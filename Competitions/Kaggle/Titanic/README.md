#Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

This repository contains my work on the Kaggle Titanic competition, where the goal is to predict passenger survival using machine learning techniques. 
The project involves an in-depth analysis of the dataset with visual graphs to uncover insights, feature engineering through custom functions to create new predictive variables, and the application of data preprocessing pipelines with transformers.
Multiple classifiers are tested, and their performance is evaluated using accuracy and ROC-AUC scores, ultimately selecting the most suitable model for final predictions.
