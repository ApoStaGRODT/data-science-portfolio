# **Sales Forecasting**

This project predicts purchase amounts in a retail dataset using machine learning techniques, focusing on feature engineering and model evaluation to achieve great accuracy.

---

## **Overview**

The primary objective of this project is to build a robust predictive model for purchase amounts using regression techniques in PySpark. Key goals include:
- Leveraging feature engineering to enhance predictive power.
- Evaluating model performance using metrics such as R², RMSE, and Adjusted R².
- Ensuring the model generalizes well to unseen data without overfitting.

## **Project Structure**

- **Sales_Forecasting.ipynb**:
  - Includes detailed data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and implementation of the regression models using PySpark.
  - Covers techniques such as one-hot encoding, Min-Max scaling, and chi-square tests for feature relevance.
  - Presents results from both linear regression and random forest regressor models.
 
  ## **Key Features**

- **Dataset**: [Customer Shopping (Latest Trends) Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhadramohit/customer-shopping-latest-trends-dataset/data)
- **Objectives**:
  - Predict purchase amounts accurately.
  - Evaluate and interpret model performance using comprehensive metrics.
