# **Loan Default Prediction**

This project predicts loan default outcomes using deep learning techniques and identifies key predictors influencing borrower behavior.

---

## **Overview**

The primary objective is to leverage deep learning models to predict loan defaults, optimize recall to minimize false negatives, and evaluate model performance. Techniques like SMOTE, feature scaling, and threshold tuning are used to handle class imbalance and improve predictions.
