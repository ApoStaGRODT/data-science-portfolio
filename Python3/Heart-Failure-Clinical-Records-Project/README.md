# Heart Failure Clinical Records Analysis

This project analyzes the Heart Failure Clinical Records dataset to identify key predictors of heart failure and evaluate the performance of various machine learning and deep learning models.

## Overview

The primary objective is to utilize machine learning and deep learning methods to determine the most significant factors affecting ejection fraction and death events in patients, and to implement and compare the effectiveness of various regression, classification, clustering, and neural network algorithms in predicting heart failure outcomes and profiling patients.

## Project Structure
